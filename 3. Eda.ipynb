    "-   Vehicles in the high-priced segment truly excel over other types of vehicles in many aspects. With superior power and engine capacity, these vehicles demonstrate that they are equipped with very powerful engines. However, this results in a larger amount of CO2 emissions and higher fuel consumption than other types of vehicles. Looking at the chart, we see that the mileage in this segment is very low, which could explain why their prices are very high. This suggests that vehicles with lower mileage, which are often newer models, are priced higher due to their superior condition and performance. \n",

This could be explained by the fact that these vehicles do not require very powerful engines, thus they do not need to use a lot of fuel and do not require a large engine capacity. These vehicles also have higher power metrics compared to low-priced vehicles.\n",
